        "content": "Disney parks typically open at 9am, but resort guests get Early Entry at 8:30am (sometimes 7:30am!). The first 2 hours have the shortest lines of the entire day — you can ride 4-5 attractions in the time it takes to ride 1 later. But here's the thing: this is vacation! If you're not a morning person, sleeping in and arriving at 11am is totally valid. The parks are open until 9-11pm, so evening crowds thin out too. We'll plan around what works for YOU."

        "content": "Florida in summer averages 90-95°F with 80-90% humidity — it feels like walking through warm soup! Even spring/fall can hit 85°F. Essential survival tips: drink water constantly (refill stations are everywhere), wear moisture-wicking clothes, use cooling towels, take indoor ride breaks. Almost every ride queue and restaurant is air-conditioned. Afternoon thunderstorms (2-4pm) actually cool things down and usually pass in 30 minutes. The parks have free water cups at any quick-service restaurant!"

Many families alternate 'big park days' (lots of walking) with 'easy days' (pool, Disney Springs shopping, resort hopping). Your feet will thank you for breaking in your shoes BEFORE the trip!"

Disney transportation (buses, monorail, Skyliner) makes this easy. If you'd rather stay, indoor rides (Haunted Mansion, Pirates, Little Mermaid) and air-conditioned shows (Festival of the Lion King, Indiana Jones Stunt Show) are perfect escapes."
