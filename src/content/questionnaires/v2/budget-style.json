Hotel is usually the biggest cost but split among the family. Money-saving secrets: bring ponchos from home ($2 vs $15 in park), pack snacks, use refillable water bottles, eat a big breakfast at the hotel, and watch for Target/Costco gift card deals on Disney gift cards (save 5-10%)!"

Souvenirs range from $5 pressed pennies to $60+ Spirit Jerseys. Park hopper upgrades ($60-70 total) let you visit multiple parks in one day. Tip: free things that are amazing include fireworks, parades, resort hopping (monorail to Grand Floridian is gorgeous), and Disney Springs entertainment!"
