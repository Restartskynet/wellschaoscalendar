The parks are designed to create these moments at every turn. Whether you're 5 or 65, first-timer or veteran, there's something that will hit different. This questionnaire helps Ben & Marie build a trip that gives YOU those moments."

Universal's CityWalk has amazing restaurants, a movie theater, and live music. There are also 2 water parks (Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach at Disney, Volcano Bay at Universal).
